# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game built with HTML Canvas and Javascript.

The main proposal of this project is to provide an example of how to develop a human-readable code. So, the code you will see here may not be the more performative one but it is supposed to be easy to understand and to maintain (focus on the developer).
